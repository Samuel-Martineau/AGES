# Cappin

## What it does

Cappin is a memes-based AI game! Make memes with your friends, but throw an AI meme into the mix. You’ll try to guess which one’s the AI meme.

Cappin has 4 phases:

Join: enter a private game room with a QR code. You’ll have an emoji and choose a username as your profile.
Make: caption a random meme template in a short time. No pressure!
Find: see all memes and guess which one’s the AI! You can laugh and vomit at memes too.
Lead: show off your meme expertise!

## How we built it

Our team used SvelteKit and Firebase for the backbone; the ImgFlip API and a fine-tuned ChatGPT-3.5 model to caption memes; GoQR for the QR code; Faker.js for user testing; Traefik for reverse proxy; Docker for containerization; and Amazon Web Services for deployment.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the rise of ChatGPT and its ability to mimic most human tasks- make music, write novels, and develop code. We wondered whether this intelligence extended to humour- that is, the ability to caption memes. Such a literary forms captures the essence of the human conditions, with its nuances and subtleties of human life and humour. Cappin is a modern Turing Test of AI humour.
